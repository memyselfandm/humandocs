# Template Files Guide

## Purpose
- Template files (`*.template.md`) serve as the base structure for document types
- These files contain placeholders to be filled with actual user data
- Templates maintain consistent document structure across the system

## Structure
- Templates begin with metadata comments
- Use clearly defined sections with numbered headings (e.g., `## 1. Dietary Foundations`)
- Placeholders are enclosed in square brackets: `[placeholder value]`

## Example Template File
The [food_preferences.template.md](mdc:hd_src/food_preferences/food_preferences.template.md) demonstrates:
- Section organization with stable IDs
- Cross-document references with double brackets `[[Links]]`
- Timestamp metadata for version tracking
- Clearly defined placeholder format
