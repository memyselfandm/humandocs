# AI Guide Files

## Purpose
- AI Guide files (`*.aiguide.md`) provide instructions and frameworks for AI systems
- They define the approach, structure, and methodology for working with corresponding templates
- Guide how AIs should interact with users regarding specific document types

## Structure
- Organized in tiers or levels of interrogation/interaction
- Include protocols for updates and maintenance
- Specify cross-document integration methods
- Define version control responsibilities

## Example AI Guide File
The [food_preferences.aiguide.md](mdc:hd_src/food_preferences/food_preferences.aiguide.md) demonstrates:
- Tiered approach to information gathering
- Update protocols for specific trigger events
- Cross-document integration guidelines
- Version control specifications

## Implementation
- AI systems should follow the frameworks defined in these guides
- Guides establish consistent interaction patterns across different AI instances
- Information gathered should map directly to placeholders in the corresponding template
