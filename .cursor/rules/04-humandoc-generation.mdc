# HumanDoc Generation Guide

## Purpose
- This rule provides guidance for AI assistants creating new HumanDoc templates and guides
- Ensures consistency in structure and approach across different document types
- Establishes the minimum requirements for creating useful documentation

## Initial User Input Requirements
- **Document category/domain**: The specific aspect of human life to document (e.g., fitness, nutrition, tech preferences)
- **Core information priorities**: What essential information must be captured (3-5 key aspects)
- **Optional information sections**: What additional context would be valuable but not essential
- **Cross-document relationships**: How this document might relate to existing HumanDoc types

## Template Structure Standards
- Start with metadata comments including versioning
- Begin with Core Metadata section (last updated, maintaining AI, linked profiles)
- Number sections sequentially with clear, stable IDs
- Clearly mark which sections are core vs. progressive
- Include placeholders using consistent format: `[placeholder]`
- End with a Dynamic History section for tracking changes and investigations

## AI Guide Structure Standards
- Begin with a Progressive Documentation Approach section
- Include tiered interrogation framework
- Specify update protocols including triggers and frequency
- Detail cross-document integration opportunities
- Provide version control guidance
- Include integration points with external systems and data sources

## Implementation Process
1. Create directory structure: `hd_src/[category_name]/`
2. Create template file: `[category_name].template.md`
3. Create AI guide file: `[category_name].aiguide.md`
4. Ensure cross-references to existing HumanDoc types are accurate
5. Structure for progressive documentation (core → extension → tracking)

## Example Creation Workflow
- Analyze user request and identify document purpose
- Determine core vs. progressive sections
- Create template with appropriate placeholders
- Develop AI guide with contextual questioning approach
- Add appropriate integration points with other documents
- Ensure update protocols match usage frequency of document type
