A standardized approach to documenting human preferences and properties.

   - Food preferences
   - Exercise and activity preferences
   - Technical preferences
   - Common personal preferences
   - And more...

2. **Question Guides**: Comprehensive lists of questions and guidelines that AI assistants can use to help users fill out and maintain their personal documentation.
