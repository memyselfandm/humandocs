## Physical Fitness Discovery Framework

### Progressive Documentation Approach
- **Initial Capture (Essential):**
  - Focus first on sections 1-4 (Goals, Current Regimen, Physical Profile, Modality Preferences)
  - Prioritize safety concerns and immediate objectives
  - Document baseline current activities before detailed preferences

- **Contextual Expansion:**
  - Add sections 5-9 progressively during relevant conversations
  - Use natural triggers (e.g., discuss nutrition when meal planning comes up)
  - Aim to complete all sections within first 1-2 weeks, but don't force all at once

- **Continuous Maintenance:**
  - Section 10 (Dynamic History) should be updated with each fitness interaction
  - Record milestones and changes as they occur rather than in dedicated sessions

### Tier 1: Foundational Interrogation
1. **Goal Assessment:**
   - "What are your primary fitness objectives right now?"
   - "Are there specific metrics or milestones you're working toward?"

2. **Safety Baseline:**
   - "Do you have any injuries or medical conditions that affect your physical activity?"
   - "Are there movements or positions you need to completely avoid?"

3. **Current Activity Mapping:**
   - "Walk me through a typical week of physical activity for you."
   - "How consistent have you been with this routine over the past month?"

### Tier 2: Contextual Deep-Dives
- **When time allows:**
  - "You mentioned enjoying [activity] - what specific aspects make it enjoyable?"
  - "For your goal of [specific goal], what has worked well in the past?"
  - "What tends to disrupt your consistency with [activity]?"

### Update Protocol
- **Trigger events:**
  - After trying new activities: "You mentioned trying [new activity] - should we update your preferences?"
  - Injury changes: "How has your [injury] been affecting your routine lately?"
  - Seasonal shifts: "With [season] approaching, should we adjust your environmental preferences?"
  - Post-exercise checkins: "I see you've completed [scheduled activity] - how did it go? Any adjustments needed to your regimen?"
  - Weekly maintenance: "It's been a week since your fitness profile was updated - would you like to review your progress or make any changes?"
  - Connected app sync: "New data from [fitness app/platform] is available - would you like me to update your profile with this information?"

### Cross-Doc Integration
1. **Implicit links:**
   - If discussing nutrition timing: `<!-- Sync with [[Food Preferences]] -->`
   - If discussing recovery: `<!-- Sync with [[Sleep Patterns]] -->`
   - If discussing schedule: `<!-- Sync with [[Calendar]] and [[Daily Schedule]] -->`
   - If discussing tracked data: `<!-- Sync with [[Connected Platforms]] -->`

2. **Explicit connections:**
   - "Your [[Food Preferences]] mention high protein needs - does this align with your current fitness goals?"
   - "How does your [[Medical History]] influence your current exercise limitations?"
   - "I notice a [workout] scheduled in your [[Calendar]] - would you like me to prompt for an update afterward?"
   - "Based on your [[Daily Schedule]], would you prefer fitness check-ins at specific times of the day?"
   - "I see your [[Connected Platforms]] include [fitness app] - should I automatically sync activity data from there?"

### Version Control
- **AI responsibilities:**
  - Date-stamp all changes to routines and goals
  - Track progress against stated metrics
  - Note correlations between routine changes and goal achievement
  - Archive previous versions in [[Fitness History]]

### External Data Integration
- **Connected platforms:**
  - Prompt for permission: "Would you like to connect [detected fitness app] to automatically update your fitness profile?"
  - Sync frequency: "How often should I check [connected app] for new fitness data?"
  - Data validation: "I noticed [unusual data] from [connected app] - is this accurate or should we exclude it?"
  - Manual override: "Would you like to manually review data from [connected app] before it's added to your profile?"
