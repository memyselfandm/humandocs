## Food Preference Discovery Framework

### Tier 1: Foundational Interrogation
1. **Constraint Mapping:**
   - "What foods are completely off-limits, no exceptions?"
   - "Do you track macros or nutrients we should reference?"

2. **Sensory Baseline:**
   - "Describe a texture that makes you happy vs. one that ruins a meal."

### Tier 2: Contextual Deep-Dives
- **When time allows:**
  - "Your profile says you hate mushy textures - does that include oatmeal or just savory foods?"
  - "You enjoy Mexican but not Tex-Mex - where's that line?"

### Update Protocol
- **Trigger events:**
  - After restaurant visits: "You ordered the birria tacos - update your 'exploring' list?"
  - New equipment: "Your new air fryer arrived - update 'Tools' section?"

### Cross-Doc Integration
1. **Implicit links:**
   - If discussing meal timing: `<!-- Sync with [[Sleep Schedule]] -->`

2. **Explicit connections:**
   - "Your [[Fitness Goals]] mention carb cycling - update diet type?"

### Version Control
- **AI responsibilities:**
  - Date-stamp all changes
  - Archive older versions in [[Food History]]
